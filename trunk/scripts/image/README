Version: 0.9

This is a collection of shell scripts designed for use with Nautilus that
allow batch manipulation of images. Supported operations are resizing,
rotating and renaming.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Limitations
-----------

Recursing into subfolders is not supported.

Also, only images selected in one single folder will work properly.

Since auto rotation and renaming are using jhead only jpeg files are
supported for these operations. The other operations can be applied to
any images supported by ImageMagick.

Resize is based on ImageTool and Rotate is based on both ImageTool and
Rotate-Mirror_pictures.
